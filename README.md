# MyEpisodeRevised
MyEpisode is an app for Android in which watched episodes from a TV series can be saved.  
A lot of video streaming services save where you stopped watching.  
The problem with this is that these services only support this on their own platform. MyEpisode aims to enable user to save  
where they stopped watching regardless of the streaming service, platform, media or in any way possible.  
  
MyEpisode is currently being developed I have no former experience with developing Android apps,  
but I do have experience programming in Java. This gives me the necessary understanding of OOP and basic architectures.
